## Short Pitch

I am creating a personal UX portfolio website based on the Academic Pages template that clearly communicates who I am as a UX designer within seconds.  
The site prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and intentional interaction over visual polish, and showcases my CV and one interactive UX paper or project to demonstrate my design thinking.  
This is a hackathon-timeboxed build focused on UX signal, not production completeness.

## Problem

Many student UX portfolios feel generic or auto-generated and fail to communicate clear UX intent, values, and strengths quickly.  
Reviewers often have limited time and struggle to understand who the designer is and what they stand for within the first few seconds.

---

## Solution

The solution is to customize the Academic Pages template into a focused, accessible UX portfolio that emphasizes clear hierarchy, intentional content, and lightweight interaction.  
The site presents a concise hero message, an accessible web-based CV, and one interactive UX paper or project to demonstrate design thinking, while avoiding unnecessary visual or technical complexity.

## Target Users

**Primary users:**  
Lecturers, peers, and hackathon reviewers who are evaluating UX design work under time constraints.

**Secondary users:**  
UX designers and potential employers browsing portfolios quickly to assess design intent and thinking.

## Use Cases

- Quickly understand who I am as a UX designer and what I focus on  
- Review my CV in a clear, accessible, web-based format  
- Explore one interactive UX paper or project to understand my process and outcomes

## North-Star Metric

A reviewer can clearly articulate who I am as a UX designer and what I focus on after spending less than 30 seconds on the site.
