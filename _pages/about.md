# Ann-Marie Atzkern

UX Designer bridging design and technology through clear interaction, accessibility, and expressive visual systems.

I am a UX designer with a background in computer science and design, focused on building clear, accessible, and visually expressive digital experiences. My work sits at the intersection of interaction design, front-end thinking, and expressive visual systems, combining analytical structure with playful, intentional aesthetics.

I am a UX designer with a background in Computer Science and Design and ongoing Master’s studies in UX Design. My work explores the space between structured problem-solving and expressive visual design, with a strong interest in interaction, accessibility, and front-end–adjacent workflows. Through academic projects and professional experience in automotive and industrial contexts, I have worked on UI/UX concepts, quality-focused digital interfaces, and visual storytelling. I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, approachable experiences and believe good UX balances logic, emotion, and intentional restraint.
